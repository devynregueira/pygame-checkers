# Introducing... Checkers!

Sure, it's 5000 years old. Sometimes you need to reinvent the wheel.

## How to play

This Checkers program is a two player game. Player one, with the yellow pieces, goes first (naturally).

Whomsoever's turn it may be will select one of their pieces. The tile will be highlighted to indicate that it's ready to move.

They'll next select their destination tile. They may only advance to an empty tile. 

The distance their piece may travel depends on whether or not they're capturing an opponent's piece, and the direction depends on which player they are and whether the piece is a king.

The winner is established once their opponent is out of pieces. Good luck!
